   <p>Our vision is to create the most exquisite jewellery.
        Each piece has a story to tell. 
        Colourful stones float effortlessly by design as precious metals
         embrace glittering diamonds in tranquil harmony. 
         Exquisite rings, delicate bracelets, distinctive earrings and eye catching pendants 
         captivates the imagination as each creation elicits an emotional reaction.</p>

         <p>Growing up in Jaipur I saw how Jewelry was crafted to capture the spirit and imagination of its owner. 
             Having the cultural tapestry of Jaipur as a backdrop, I envisioned how history and architecture can inspire
              to create a unique balance in design, 
             offering its owner a new legacy to be cherished.
             To take this vision forward my brother and I launched VR Jewels. With our family showroom to inspire and
              his passion for acquiring quality gems the VR online collection was born.  </p>
